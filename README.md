# Fullstack React + NodeJS - home assignment

## Statement of work ( SOW ):
- During your work use the https://pokeapi.co/ REST API.
- Enable the user to register
- Enable the user to log in
- Enable the user to log out
- Enable the user to catch and release a pokemon
- Each user related (list, catch, release) endpoints should be authorized endpoints, only logged in users are able to reach them
- Show the list of pokemons catched by the user and allow the user to release them
- Filter and sort the catched pokemons
- List the different types of pokemons on the main screen (use a dropdown menu or picker)
- When a type is selected, list all the pokemon names which are assigned to this type
- Include a search bar, to enable searching in all pokemons by name
- Upon selection of a pokemon, navigate to a profile card where you show some details about the selected pokemon
The detailed profile card needs to include: a picture of the pokemon, name of pokemon, weight, height, not hidden abilities
- On the same screen implement a 'catch' button. On click, the pokemon should be catched. You will need to mark the catched pokemons on the list (for example: green border around the name). When a pokemon is catched, the button should turn to 'release', so if you want to release them back to the wild you can.
